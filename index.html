			<p> Luck is grat but most of life is hard work. Always remember to do the difficult things
			while they are easy and the great thigs while they are small. Not to blow my trumpet but it's hard to be humble
			when you are as great as I am. Napoleon Hill once famously said, whatever the mind of a man can conceive and believe, it can
			achieve it. The most difficult thing is the decision to start, the rest is just merely tenacity. Finally, my people, Life isn't about
			getting and having, its's about giving and being.
